# PicStream Loader

PicStream Loader is a small practice project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It uses the **Picsum API** to fetch random photos and displays them in a clean, responsive grid. Users can click the **"Load More"** button to dynamically add new random images.

## ðŸ”¥ Features
- Fetches random photos from [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos)
- Fixed image size (300x300) with smooth shadows and rounded corners
- "Load More" button to dynamically add new images
- Simple, responsive design

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Practiced
- DOM manipulation with `createElement` and `appendChild`
- Event handling with JavaScript
- Using external APIs for random images
- CSS styling with shadows, hover effects, and flexbox

## ðŸ“¸ Demo
